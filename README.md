# Data Science Portfolio
A portfolio of data science projects I created to grow my coding skills in R and Python. While I address several different topics, my projects cluster around  focuses on international development and humanitarian data and the politics of fragile states.

I hope you enjoy exploring the data alongside me.

     - [Supervised Learning Project: Predicting Political Attitudes with Developing Country Government Data](https://github.com/casbahboy/data_sci/blob/master/Python/supervised_learning_project:_predictiving_politicla_attitudes.ipynb): This code attempts to create a model which uses administrative data available to authoritarian developing states to predict attitudes toward the authoritarian regime, with supervised learning. The data used comes from a social cohesion survey conducted in Armenia in 2011. Results are inconclusive, and are meant purely as a demonstration of grasp of machine learning concepts.

     - [Inferential Statistics: Does a dietary supplement make people smarter?](https://rpubs.com/tliptrot/581110): A dietary supplement marketer has organized a study to investigate the effects of their product. They had randomly assigned students take different supplements or none, then complete mental math problems as fast as they good. But did the supplements really make people smarter?

     - [Visualizing Survey Data and Linear Regression - Attitudes toward Syrian refugees among rural Jordanians](https://rpubs.com/tliptrot/567264): Uses survey data from humanitarians to vizualize correlations between demographic characteristics and attitudes toward refugees. What subsets of Jordanians have particularly trusting attitudes toward Jordanians?

     - [Data Vizualization: The Natural Resource Curse](https://rpubs.com/tliptrot/593873): In this demo, I will make an economist style plot from a multiple country linear regression. For my data I will use country level data from the seminal paper "Natural Resource Abundance and Economic Growth" by Sachs and Warner, which argued that the presence of natural resources in a country caused lower growth.

     - [Data Vizualization: Covid Cases by Country (WIP)]() In this demo, I plot the log of total confirmed cases against days since first 5 cases found for a representative sample of countries.
